# Given a sample of the output of a neural net, can we recover its weights?
For a special class of neural nets that are random and sparse, their weights can be recovered solely by observing pairwise correlations between nodes in the output layer. This project empirically demonstrates the work by Arora et al. on this property of random neural nets.

A high-level review of the team's paper is included, along with code in python that demonstrates some of their results.
